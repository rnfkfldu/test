# Parent's Legacy (자서전 생성기)

## Overview

A heartwarming web application designed to help users generate a draft of their parents' autobiography based on limited inputs. It features a warm, nostalgic interface suitable for storytelling.

## Project Outline

*   **`index.html`**: Structured with semantic HTML5. Features a tabbed interface for "자서전 생성" (Generate), "제휴문의" (Inquiry), and "커뮤니티" (Community).
*   **`style.css`**: Implements a "Writer's Room" aesthetic. Uses Serif fonts, warm beige/paper tones, and comfortable spacing to evoke a sense of memory and respect.
*   **`main.js`**: Handles the logic for collecting user inputs (Name, Era, Keywords) and simulating the generation of an autobiography draft using a template engine.
